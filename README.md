# fizzbuzz-jasmine
FizzBuzz kata in JavaScript using Jasmine and Node.js

## Kata

The rules of FizzBuzz are simple:

1. Any number not divisble by 3 or 5 returns the input number
2. Any number divisible by 3 returns "Fizz"
3. Any number divisible by 5 returns "Buzz"
4. Any number divisible by both 3 and 5 returns "FizzBuzz"

## Setup

1. Install [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/lang/en/docs/install/). (This will also install Node.js if you don't already have it.)
2. `yarn install`
3. There is no Step 3.

##  Running Tests

`yarn test` will run the tests once. 

`yarn run tdd` will automatically re-run the tests every time you save a file.
